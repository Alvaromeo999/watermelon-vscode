# Contributing to Watermelon's extension development

For now, we discuss on [Discord](https://t.co/fMIlnb9egq).

## Running the extension
To run:
1. Open the folder containing the code on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Press "F5" or go to the debug panel and click "Run Extension".

Make sure you:
1. Have logged in with your github account on VSCode.
2. The folder you are accessing is NOT in restricted mode.

When commiting, our all the tests will run to check nothing broke.

## Release

### VSCode

To release a new version of the extension, we use [vsce](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#vsce). This requires being part of the team and having access to the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/watermelon-tools).

First, create a PR from `dev` to `master` with the title _v{version_number}_ (e.g. v1.6.3). Then, test it and get at least one approval.

Second, on your local machine, pull the latest `master` and run `vsce publish {version_name}`. This will publish the new version to the marketplace.

### VSCodium

We use the .vsix from the VSCode Marketplace to publish to VSCodium. After the previous steps, run `npx ovsx publish -p {your_token}` to release the new version to VSCodium. This generally takes longer than the VSCode Marketplace.
