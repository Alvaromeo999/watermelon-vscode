# Markdown as paper renderer  
## Introduction   
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is an specification that extends markdown as a whole. It renders on the webpage properly and allows pretty complicated stuff.

For this RFC, the proposal is to put that into the markdown renderer on VSCode to extend the capabilities of documentation in the programmers workflow. One of the huge pain points is that systems are complicated and distant from the code, where programmers are at home.
