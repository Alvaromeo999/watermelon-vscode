# Daily Summary
We want the developers to start their day by looking at watermelon.

With the daily summary feature, watermelon will become the center of their standup. We will do this automatically, without asking.

## How it looks

## Technical challanges
This is a pretty straightforward feature.
We query the API at a determined time, sort it and add it, but we got to think about how do we do it daily and show it once.

## Discussion

Should the developer be able to see it at any time?

This feature pushes a lot on GitHub, where our community lives, do we need to add more?
